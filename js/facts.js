`I am proud of the effort I have put into PHE this year. I
participated in the activities we did with a good attitude,
even if I did not enjoy them. I could see improvement between
my fitness tests because I was putting more effort into the
workout videos and the activities that we did. I think that
my effort and my attention impacted my experience this year
because the more effort I put in, the better results I got.
The better results I got the more I enjoyed it. You can see
the progression I made throughout my fitness tests. I can
improve the consistency of my attitude by getting more sleep
and eating better in the morning. This will help me be in
a better mood each morning and it will help me work harder
in PHE.`,
`Some things I did not enjoy throughout PHE was out Peer
Teaching unit and our mindfulness activities. With Peer
Teaching, we were assigned to groups so I was put in a
group with people I did not work very well with. I also
was on a trip to Ontario while we were planning the
lessons, so I did not get much involvement in teaching or
planning. It ended up being quite boring for me. I think
that Peer Teaching is important because it allows us to
experience what it would be like to be a teacher and it
gives us a different perspective.I also did not enjoy our
mindfulness lessons. I find it extremely distracting and
a little creepy to have someone taking in my ear non-stop
about taking breaths or whatever. I honestly would have
better results if I did it myself in a quiet environment.
Mindfulness is important because it helps balance our
emotions and stress throughout the day, which contributes
to our overall mental health.`,
`I feel like I've improved the most in my physical fitness
this year. I also did cross country in the first semester
so I was improving my physical fitness in two different
ways at a time. The workout and fitness videos helped me
the most because it gave me a way to improve myself very
quickly. I noticed this improvement as we did the fitness
tests because I noticed that I could do more before I got
tired and I saw that my results were higher then before.
Another thing that helped me was the games we did in class.
This helped me improve my fitness while having fun with my
peers at the same time.`,
`One of my highlights in PHE this year was the disc golf unit.
I've been playing disc golf by myself for a long time, but I
did not know the proper form or techniques. This unit gave me
the opportunity to improve my skills and win some more games.`,
`Another highlight I had in PHE this year was the games we did
this year. These games helped me collaborate with my classmates
and compete against my classmates. The games were fun and engaging
and it helped me get more exercise without thinking much about it.`
